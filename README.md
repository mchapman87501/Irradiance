# Irradiance

The Irradiance package is a Swift translation of the spectrl2 C code from NREL's [Bird Simple Spectral Model](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/spectral.html).  It depends on [SolarPos](https://github.com/mchapman87501/SolarPos.git), which is a Swift implementation of NREL's Solar Position Algorithm for Solar Radiation Applications.
